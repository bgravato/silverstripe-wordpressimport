##Requirements
mod_rewrite (optional if you need to cater for old incoming links)
SilverStripe 3.1.x
silverstripe/blog
silverstripe/comments

##Installation Instructions

    composer require silverstripe/wordpressimport 3.1.*@dev

###Usage Overview
It will change any links to uploaded images and 
files in your posts that follow the convention 
"http://yourdomain.com/wp-content/uploads/yyyy/mm/filesname.jpg" 
to "http://yourdomain.com/assets/Uploads/yyyy/mm/filesname.jpg" 
which allows you to migrate you uploaded images 
and files over to SilverStripe assets folder while maintaining 
images in your posts.

###Optional Rewriting
Add this in your .htaccess file to port old 
wordpress posts in the form /yyyy/mm/name-of-post/
 to new SilverStripe /blog/name-of-post convention.

<code>
RewriteRule ^[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/(.*)$ /blog/$1 [R,L]
</code>



##Known issues:
Content can lose a lot of the formatting coming from Wordpress.
Perhaps parsing the content through a nl2br might help?
Image captions need to be catered for and styled otherwise they end up looking like un-parse shortcodes.
